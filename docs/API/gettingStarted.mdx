## Using the API

All API methods are below, in the other categories. The API expects JSON data in the request body.

### Ratelimit
The ratelimit is 60 requests per 60 seconds. For example you can send 60 requests in a 5 seconds, however you will not be able to send any more requests for 55 seconds.

The following headers will be set so you know when you should retry your request:

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Retry-After`           | time (in seconds) to wait until the next request can be sent, only present when ratelimited |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | request limit per minute                                                                    |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | number of requests left for the time window                                                 |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | amount of seconds before the requests left in the time window resets                        |
